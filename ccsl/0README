 ***** DISTRIBUTED FILES *****
The CCSL can be downloaded by anonymous ftp from  ftp.ill.fr/public/dif/ccsl
as the compressed archive ccsl.tar.gz. The archive should be decompressed
and the constituent files unpacked, with the command
  tar -xzf ccsl.tar.gz
The files should be unpacked into a directory which is NOT the final
target for CCSL.

For the CCSL source (library and programs only)
The archive contains the following files:

0README               This file
CCSLtests.pl         Script to run the tests in /testdata
Install			     Perl script to install all files in the recommended
                     directory tree
aliases              Aliases
ccsl_choices.opt     Site and system choices
ccsl.pl              Perl script manipulate the master file
extract.pl           Perl script called by ccsl to extract a "part" from the
                     master file
f77_choices.opt      Compiler commands
gnuplt.opt           Gnuplot terminal options
graphics_choices.opt Choice of graphics driver
list_of_progs.opt    List of programs to be created as executables
Makefile             File to make the library and executables for chosen
mistre.ss            The CCSL master file
load.pl              Perl script to create a makefile and load a program with selected subroutines
parlist.opt          List of local preferences for values of symbolic
                     parameters
testdata             Test data for some CCSL programs

 ***** INSTALLING THESE  FILES (BOURNE shell) *****
Edit the Install script so that the first line gives the location of Perl
on your system.

set the environment variable CCSL to the directory in which the the system is to
be installed. Then do

./Install <part> $CCSL

Running the Install script will install the <part> (all, source or doc):
in a directory structure rooted at the directory $CCSL.
If no arguments are given to the Install script the part and root directory
are obtained interactively.

After installation of "all" or "source" the root directory $CCSL should have
subdirectories  exe, graf, options, perl, lib  source and testdata.
After installing "all" or "doc" there should be the additional subdirectory doc.

 ***** QUICK BUILD *****

cd $CCSL
source environment
make all

the "source environment" command sets the CCSL environment variables approriately.
The "make all" command should build the CCSL library archive and executable versions
of chosen main programs according to the options given in the $CCSL_OPT directory.
(Note: "make lib" will build the library only)
When the script is complete $CCSL_SRC should contain:
libmk4.f    the Fortran source code of the library
maimk4.f    the Fortran source code of the main programs provided
mistre.ss   the CCSL Master file
pigmk4.f    the Fortran source code of the graphics drivers

$CCSL_LIB should contain:
libmk4.a    the library archive

$CCSL_EXE should contain executables of all the chosen main programs

Fortran errors are reported in the file fortran.errors and fortran modules which
failed to compile are ib the directory names "bad"

 ***** CHOICES *****
It is unlikely that the default options included with the distribution
will be appropriate for installations other than ILL and it will be
necessary to edit files in the  $CCSL_OPT directory in order to get
the above quick installation to work.

The $CCSL_OPT directory contains files that are used to define options
used in building the library and loading programs. They are:

ccsl_choices         defines the system and site preferences
f77_choices          the commands to compile and link F77 modules
graphics_choices     version of CCSL graphics driver to be used and the
                     location of any graphics library needed
list_of_progs        a list of main programs to be created as executables
                     each name may be followed by a switch -(pgs)
                       -p uses CCSL graphics drivers
                       -g uses chosen grtaphics library
                       -s uses CCSL postscript graphics.
parlist              a list of symbolic parameters to be given values
                     different from their default values, together with
                     their chosen new values. (see Appendix C of the CCSL
                     manual)
The option files included with the distribution indicate the switches
used at ILL on Silicon Graphics computers running IRIX 6.5 and PowerMacs
G4/G5 running OSX.10.2/.4.
In these files any line or part of a line starting # is taken to be
comment and is not interpreted by the scripts.
