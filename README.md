# Cambridge Crystallography Subroutine Library

CCSL is a library of subroutines for doing crystallographic and related calculations. It is designed not so much as a set of programs for determining and refining structures, for which several other systems are available, but as toolbox to allow the crystallography of non-trivial structures to be easily introduced into user programs.

## Origin and Licence

In September 2021, CCDC reached out to Prof. Brown in order to relicence the CCSL library under the MIT licence under the Open Sourcing DASH project.

Prof. Brown provided us with an up to date archive of the source code and granted CCDC permission to relicence it under the MIT licence.

The code in the 4.4.39 tag in this repository accurately reflects the contents of the archives provided by Prof. Brown. The original archives can be found in the [4.4.39 release](https://github.com/ccdc-opensource/ccsl/releases/tag/4.4.39).
