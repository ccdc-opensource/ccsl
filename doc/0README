 ***** INSTALLING THESE  FILES (BOURNE shell) *****
Edit the Install script so that the first line gives the location of Perl
on your system.

Ensure that the environment variable CCSL is set to the directory in which
the the system is installed. Then do

./Install  $CCSL

Running the Install script will install the documentation in
a directory structure rooted at the directory $CCSL/DOC.
If no argument is are given to the Install script the root directory
will be obtained interactively.

After installation the root directory $CCSL should have aquired the subdirectory
doc with  further subdirectories appenx,ffacts, html, icons, mk4man, pdf and texes..

 ***** QUICK BUILD *****

cd $CCSL
source environment
cd doc
make all

the "source environment" command sets the CCSL environment variable CCSL_DOC
(added to environment by the install script) approriately.
Assuming LaTeX and TeX4ht are installed on your system
The "make all" command should build the CCSL documentation in both the
htlm and pdf formats
When complete the following postscript files should be in  $CCSL_DOC/pdfs
	CCSLman.pdf
    apendixD.pdf
	appendixA.pdf
	appendixC.pdf
	appendixE.pdf
The link to the html version is $CCSL_DOCS/htlm/ccsldoc.htm.

Once all the documentation has been successfully compiled, unnecessary work
files can be removed by executing "make clean"
The complete set of files created by "make all" can be removed by
executing "make clear".
