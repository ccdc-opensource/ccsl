<h1> Subdivisions of CCSL</h1></a>
For convenience the library has been divided into <em>parts</em> as follows:
<dl>
<dt> LIB
<dd> The main library which contains routines used by all CCSL programs. It
should be the last of the CCSl parts to be loaded by the linker.
<p>
<dt>MAI
<dd> A collection of CCSL main programs of general interest. This part should
<strong>not</strong> be made into a searchable library. Some of the main programs have
their own special subroutines attached. These are recognised by not being
preceeded by a C LEVEL line. They will be extracted correctly with the MAIN
program to which they belong by the <a href="ccsltools.html#GET"> GET 
</a> procedure.
<p>
<dt>PJB, JBF
<dd> Some special MAIN programs, not of general interest or guaranteed to
work!
<p>
<dt>PIG
<dd> Graphics routines for driving various different output devices.
Essentially contains several different versions of the subroutine PIGLET and
attachments. The different versions are distinguished by the name in the C
LEVEL line, and may be extracted under this alias by GET. For instance the
tektronix version is called PIGTEK and the GKS version PIGGKS. Some hints about
how to load <a href = "ccsltools.html#cslgraf">graphics programs</a> 
are available.
<p>
<dt> PR
<dd> Subroutines used for profile refinement. Not needed by programs in the MAI
part of the library.
<p>
<dt>PF 
<dd> Subroutines for profile refinement of time-of-flight data. Mostly
different types of peak fitting function.
<p>
<dt> PMA
<dd> Main programs for profile refinement. Like MAI this part should not be
made into a search library. 
<p>
<dt> NEW
<dd> Experimental code, not for general use.
